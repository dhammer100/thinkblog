# Thinking

This is a place for me to write content and keep thoughts for posterity. Social media is a bore and I don't want to spend any more time on it than necessary. So, I publish here. 

What will I write about? General interests besides tech are travel, wine, food (preparation and consumption), hiking, cycling and a plethora of other things. It might be interesting or not.

Today, I am flying to Singapore for the first time in about 6 years. Other than a number of work trips to India, I have not been back in Asia in a while. And to top it off, I am continuing to Manila on Monday for work meetings. Will be interesting to see how these places have changed. Manila - haven't been back there for over 10 years, but that will make its own blog post no doubt. 

Flying with SQ is always a blast from the past... I used to do that a lot, into all directions, but of course mainly between SIN and MEL on I think SQ227. Now on route to new, updated adventures

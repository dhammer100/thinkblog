Other than a number of work trips to India, I have not been back in Asia in a while. And to top it off, I am continuing to Manila on Monday for work meetings. Will be interesting to see how these places have changed. Manila - haven&rsquo;t been back there for over 10 years, but that will make its own blog post no doubt.</p>
<p>Flying with SQ is always a blast from the past&hellip; I used to do that a lot, into all directions, but of course mainly between SIN and MEL on I think SQ227. Now on route to new, updated adventures.</p>
<p>The business class seat&hellip; I remember when it came out while I was stationed in Singapore. The size alone, epic. It&rsquo;s current incarnation feels a bit more cramped than my memory leads me to believe. But the bed is outright uncomfortable. Hard like lying on the floor, the temperature in the cabin too hot. Not the best sleep I had in a plane (that honor goes to Swiss First as well as LH Business).</p>
